## Requirements

- Minecraft Java Edition 26.3
- Fabric Loader 0.19.5 or newer
- Fabric API for Minecraft 26.3
- Entity Model Features 3.3.8 or newer
- Entity Texture Features 7.2.4 or newer
- Entity Sound Features 0.8.2 or newer

EMF, ETF, and ESF are external dependencies. This project does not bundle or
modify them.

Mod Menu is optional. When installed, its Configure button opens the Villager
News settings directly. Without Mod Menu, the same settings remain available
in the Villager News Handbook.

## Installation

1. Install Fabric Loader for Minecraft 26.3.
2. Download Fabric API, EMF, ETF, and ESF for the same Minecraft version.
3. Put the dependency jars and the Villager News Addon Port jar in the
   Minecraft `mods` folder.
4. Start Minecraft with the Fabric profile.

The dialogue controller runs on the server. For multiplayer, install the mod
and its dependencies on both the server and every connecting client so models,
animations, textures, and sounds are available to everyone.

## Characters

Use a name tag on a villager to select a character model and voice:

| Name tag | Character |
| --- | --- |
| `Mayor`, `Mayor Villager`, or `The Mayor` | Mayor Villager |
| `Testificate Man` | Testificate Man |
| `Villager Number 5` or `Villager #5` | Villager Number 5 |
| `Villager Number 9` or `Villager #9` | Villager Number 9 |
| `Villager Unreachable` or `Can't Catch Me!` | Villager Unreachable |

Name a sheep `Wooly` or `Wooly The Sheep` to use Wooly's model, animations,
and sounds. Ordinary villagers and wandering traders receive their Villager
News appearance and dialogue automatically.

Special characters can also appear naturally as new distant villages are
generated. Each character appears once at a time and becomes eligible to spawn
again after being killed.

Pillagers use 48 recorded reactions with matching subtitles. Their ambient
comments are spaced roughly 3 to 5 minutes apart.

## Items

All custom items are available in the **Villager News** creative-mode tab.

Craft the Villager News Handbook from three pieces of paper. It includes the
add-on's overview, special-character and cosmetic guides, settings reference,
social and support pages, and the complete searchable Triggers & Reactions
guide.

Shear an adult villager to remove its nose. Interact with that villager while
holding the nose to return it. The Mayor, Testificate Man, Villager #5, and
Villager #9 sell their matching cosmetics. Cosmetics can be given to ordinary
villagers and removed again with shears.

## Dialogue

Villagers react to what happens around them. They can comment when a player
approaches, stares, changes game mode, wears armor, receives an effect, breaks
or places a block, uses an item, completes a trade, or spawns a villager with a
spawn egg. They also react to their profession, workstation, level, biome,
weather, time of day, nearby entities, damage source, and other villagers.

The server chooses the exact voice variant and broadcasts its matching
animation. Each speaker remains occupied for the real length of the clip,
preventing unrelated lines from overlapping. Conversation partners take turns
and continue looking at each other throughout multi-part exchanges.

Pillagers comment on nearby players, villagers, iron golems, raid groups,
combat, and other pillagers. Their head and arm gestures use the existing
Villager News animation timelines while keeping the vanilla pillager model.

## Building from source

On Windows:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build
```

On Linux or macOS:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The distributable jar is written to `build/libs`.

To include the operator-only dialogue test command in a development build, set
`dialogue_test_command=true` in `gradle.properties` before building. Use
`/dialoguetest <1-571>` in game to spawn the matching speaker and subject, play
every variant from that dialogue group, and remove the test actors when each one ends.
Use `/dialoguetest continuous` to run all 571 groups in order. Each group is
announced with its variant number in chat, and the next variant begins one second
after the current voice line finishes.
The setting defaults to `false` for release builds.

Run the asset and dialogue verification with:

```powershell
node tools/verify-port.mjs
```

After extracting the original Bedrock packs into `build/bedrock-source`, create
a formatted copy of the complete add-on, a dialogue symbol map, a feature
inventory, and a Java dialogue coverage report with:

```powershell
node tools/deobfuscate-addon.mjs
```

The output is written to `build/deobfuscated-bedrock-source/full-addon`.
Wooly's smaller focused source map can also be generated with:

```powershell
node tools/deobfuscate-wooly.mjs
```

The focused output is written to `build/deobfuscated-bedrock-source/wooly`. The
known source symbols are documented in
[`docs/bedrock-deobfuscation/wooly.md`](docs/bedrock-deobfuscation/wooly.md).
